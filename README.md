## [Snowdrift.coop](https://snowdrift.coop)

Snowdrift.coop is a *multi-stakeholder* (aka *solidarity*) co-op web platform being built to provide a more cooperative and effective funding system for public goods. Public goods are those which everyone can share without limit and without exclusion such as free/libre/open software, music, art, research, and so on. An ethical democratic economy should not accept the artificial restrictions that turn public goods into exclusive club goods, but we still need ways to fund the work that goes into development. Snowdrift.coop provides a web platform for independent free/libre/open projects to get patronage support from the community via a pledge: patrons agree to fund the projects they like by donating a base amount per the number of total patrons (for example, donating $1 per month for every 1,000 patrons who donate with me). As a co-op, anyone funding the site itself can be a member, and members are split into three classes: the workers who develop the platform, the people who get funded to work on their independent projects, and the general patrons who only donate. As of 2015, Snowdrift.coop is still a work-in-progress accepting startup donations and volunteer help to get the system running.

WTF Kooperative eG (Werkkooperative der Technikfreund*innen) was founded in December 2020 and brings valuable expert know-how most diverse disciplines of information technology to the table.
From the start, more than 150 people found each other and worked to successful founding of the cooperative.

A company that belongs to all of us, in which each of us has a voice and the right to have a say.
